      <div class="about_content"><br>Grundämne first opened its doors in July 15 2017. Its co-owners are Felix Arvid Karlsson and Head Chef Oskar Jönsson.<p>Grundämne is the Swedish word for "element". This name is certainly reflected in the menu offered here. There are 4 seasonal menus, crafted around the concepts of the 4 Empedoclesian elements of the natural world (fire, water, earth and air). These menus are built around the local produce driven cuisine here at Grundämne with a focus on reflecting the changing seasons and the raw nature of Sweden.<p>The restaurant has 20 tables in the main dining room as well as 5 private rooms, giving guests a direct view to the dining room as well as the marvellous skyline of the city of Göteborg. Grundämne has been widely praised by many food critics and just 1 year and half after opening, Grundämne was awarded its first Michelin star.<p>A reservation is not required though it is highly encouraged. Reservations can be taken <a href="contact.html" class="aboutlink">here</a>.</div>
